# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
1. Severity: LOW
A low severity implies that the activity, while potentially unusual, is not considered highly risky or impactful in the immediate term. This could be a benign attempt or preliminary reconnaissance rather than a confirmed attack.

2. Target Information
The instance is running in a publicly accessible configuration with SSH (port 22) exposed. The actor's IP, 10.192.11.64, suggests it may be an internal IP address within the same VPC or a connected environment, which may indicate either:
An accidental or misconfigured access attempt.
Malicious activity within the VPC.

3. Actor and Connection Details
The actorâ€™s IP address and source port (47494) point to the origin of the attempt.
The connection was inbound but not blocked, meaning the security group or network ACLs allowed the connection to reach the instance.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
Amazon GuardDuty detects brute force attacks by analyzing various data sources such as VPC Flow Logs, DNS logs, and CloudTrail event logs. These data sources provide insights into unusual activities, like repetitive failed login attempts or unauthorized access attempts targeting your AWS resources.
Additionally, GuardDuty incorporates advanced anomaly detection algorithms and domain reputation checks to flag activity associated with known bad actors or compromised IP addresses, further enhancing its detection accuracy.
