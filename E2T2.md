Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

## EC2 instances should use Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) - HIGH
This is a high vulnerability that needs to be addressed immediately. The older version of IMDS provides attackers with the EC2 instances metadata, which includes users' credentials. Attackers can leverage this with other attacks like SSRF to exploit the cloud environments and infrastructure.
Suggested Remediation:
Update the IMDS to version 2 to make sure that all the GET requests to retrieve EC2 Metadata are authenticated. This prevents further exploit from attackers.


## Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPSL - MEDIUM
As the architecture does not use HTTPS for the load balancers, the traffics is not encrypted, hence results in insecure communications between 
users and the application stacks.
Suggested Remediation:
- Configure the AWS Load Balancers to use HTTPs for the traffics
- Ensure that all HTTP connections are redirected to HTTPs communications. 


## S3 general purpose buckets should have server access logging enabled - MEDIUM
It is always a best practice to monitor S3 events. This not only helps us track all activities on S3 buckets but also provides insights for analysis should an incident happens. In this scenario, the S3 bucket that contains secret recipes should be paid more attention and enabled log monitoring to make sure only authorized people get access to.
Suggested Remediation:
- Enable log monitoring on S3 buckets
- For bucket containing secret recipes, add other layers of security like authentication, MFA, etc.
