## Scan infrastructure as code templates
Terrascan: https://runterrascan.io/
TfFlint: https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint
Checkov: https://www.checkov.io/
snyk: https://snyk.io/

The above tools can help identify and prevent misconfigurations, security risks and compliance violation by scanning IaC files, which provides detailed reports on the issues. Some tools like Terrascan feature a comprehensive library of predefined policies and allows users to create custom policies, ensuring taht IaC remains secure and compliant throughout the development lifecycle.

### Example
Using Snyk, we can identify some misconfigurations in the IaC files like "Default VPC Security Group allow open ingress".

## Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
Anchore: https://anchore.com/
Clair: https://github.com/quay/clair
Dagda: https://github.com/eliasgranderubio/dagda/

The above tools perform static analysis of know vulnerabilities using anti-virus engine to scan and detect trojans, viruses, malware contained within Docker images.

### Example
CVE-2022-0847 Dirty Pipe
This vulnerability allow attackers to change the content of files that they don't have permissions, which then can be used for privilege escalation to take over the machine.

## Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.
Tools: AWS Config, AWS GuardDuty, AWS Inspector

### Example
These tools help identify misconfigurations (S3 Bucket does not requires request to use SSL, EC2 instance uses IDMSv1 which has a major security issues, etc)
AWS GuardDuty also helps identify and logs attacks like Bruteforce, DDoS, XSS, etc.
