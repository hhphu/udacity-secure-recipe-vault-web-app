Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The Load Balancer does not use HTTPS, meaning the connection between teh client and the public-facing web application is not secure.

# Poor practice 2
S3 buckets are not placed in the private subnets. In the diagram, becasue the buckets are displayed in teh public, attackers can easily retrieve recipes. By putting the S3 buckets behind the private networks, we can make it harder for attackers to enumerate and exploit the buckets.

# Poor practice 3 
There is no Web Application Firewalls for the public-facing Web Application. As the application is public-facing, it is vulnerable to multiple exploits like SQL Injeciton, XSS, DDoS, etc. Having a Web Application Firewall in place helps us prevent potential threats.From the diagram, if there were a WAF set up, the malicious script may not have passed.

# Poor practice 4
Depneding on the business logics, we may want to require users to authenticate themselves before trying to retrieve the recipes. By authenticating users, we add one more layer of protection to the S3 buckets. Onces users are aunthenticated, they will be able to make API requests to retrieve information from S3 buckets. These users will be managed by IAM Users and IAM Role Policies.

# Poor Practice 5
Similarly, privileged business users should authenticated themselves to get the secrte recipes. MFA and other forms of authentication mechanism are highly recommended to enhance the security posture.
